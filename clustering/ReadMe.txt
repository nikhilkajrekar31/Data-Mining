In this project we used the provided data of ATNT & Handwritten images to cluster data using K-Means provided by Sklearn library & later using linear_assignment_ for Hungarian algorithm. Code also generates a confusion matrix using sklearn library to obtain accuracy

1 - On ATNT100 images data the accuracy obtained by clustering(n=10) using k-Means and provided Hungarian algorithm code was roughly 96% (this varies by each observation due to possible bad choice of initial centroid) 

2 - On ATNT400 images data the accuracy obtained by clustering(n=40)  using k-Means and provided Hungarian algorithm code was roughly 74% (this varies by each observation due to possible bad choice of initial centroid) 

3 - On HandwrittenImages data the accuracy obtained by clustering(n=26)  using k-Means and provided Hungarian algorithm code was roughly 74% (this varies by each observation due to possible bad choice of initial centroid)
